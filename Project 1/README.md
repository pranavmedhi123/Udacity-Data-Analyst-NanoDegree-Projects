# Explore Weather Trends
## by Pranav Medhi


## Weather Dataset

> There are three tables in the database:
city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database. Look through them in order to find the city nearest to you.
city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).


## Summary of Findings

- I have used two exploratory methods for exploring the trends in the data. First, I have used a normal visualisation for comparing the weather trends between the city I selected(Dallas) and the global trends. Second, I got the moving averages of the weather trends over a period of 10years as it helps in smoothening the figure and facilitates observing the bigger picture instead of the little fluctuations that dont matter much.

Observations
- From the line chart it is clear that Dallas has always been hotter than the global temperature 
averages. The calculated average temperature of Dallas from 1820-2013 was 18.04 degree 
Celsius while that of the globe for the same year range was 8.47 degree Celsius.
- In the range of years 1997-2013 the global temperature average has been climbing slightly 
with regular increments. While temperature averages in Dallas, also have been rising but with 
some fluctuations such as the dip in 2008 and again a steep increase moving forward.
- Generally, the line chart for Dallas has had steep rises and falls as compared to the globe. 
Where the globe has also had changes but they have been rather smooth.
- Looking closely at the Dallas line chart, we can say that the peek temperatures witnessed were 
in the years 1836, 1955, 2004. All in all we can conclude that the worlds, average temperature 
has been rising steadily. Even though there is just a 2-3 degree Celsius of overall increment over 
the span of 1820-2013 in the global averages, it is a matter of concern because that 2-3 degrees is 
just an average and doesn’t specify the extremes, which make the most of the climate change 
take place.
